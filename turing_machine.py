"""
Implementing Classic (1 tape) Turing Machine to recognize L = {0^k 1^k 2^k | k â‰¥ 0}

The algorithm is as follows:
- Marks '$' as tape start and '_' as final symbol
- Looks for first '0' and then marks with 'X'
- Then looks for the first '1' and marks with 'Y'; do the same with '2', marking 'Z'
- Then verifies if the tape is all marked
